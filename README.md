# üßæ Anamnesis Form ‚Äì Automated PDF Analysis

This project focuses on the automated analysis and processing of anamnesis forms commonly used in medical documentation.  
The goal is to extract printed content from PDF forms, evaluate checkboxes, and match results against a predefined catalog of statements.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to the sensitive nature of the data and documents, the **source code of this repository is not publicly available**.

## üß© Project Overview

The pipeline consists of several stages:

1. **PDF Conversion**: Convert PDF files into high-resolution images.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Binarize and deskew images to enhance OCR performance.
3. **Text Extraction (OCR)**: Use Tesseract to extract text and detect checkboxes.
4. **Checkbox Analysis**: Recognize and classify "Yes"/"No" checkbox markings.
5. **Catalog Matching**: Match extracted sentences to a reference statement catalog.
6. **Export**: Output the structured results into CSV files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Functions

### Converts a PDF into image files
```python
pdf_to_images(pdf_path)
```

### Preprocessing steps
```python
binarize_image(image)
deskew_image(img_path)
```

### Extract and identify keywords via OCR
```python
get_sentences(img)
get_keywords(words, df)
```

### Detect and filter checkbox data
```python
get_checkboxes(...)
filter_checkboxes_for_outliers(...)
```

### Save results in structured format
```python
export_to_csv(data, file)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- OCR Accuracy depends on scan quality and font.
- Checkbox Detection may fail with very small or unclear boxes.
- At the moment only supports PDF and JPG inputs.
